        Inspired by Deaner's love of country music, this record saw the band tackle their most cohesive porject to date
        a full length country record featuring tracks about life on the range, touring and partying and those tender country moments. 
        The title 12 Golden Country Greats refers to the 12 session Nashville musicians that were brought onboard to create this record, 
        though it is often mistaken to refer to the tracks themselves (in spite of there being only ten songs on the record).
